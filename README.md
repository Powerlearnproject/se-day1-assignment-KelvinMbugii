#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science associated with developing,testing and maintaining software.
   Importance: i. Scalability -> Ensures the development of softwares that can handle an increased load without
                                 efficiency performance.
              ii. Reliability -> Ensures the development of softwares that performs as per the expectations.
            iii.  Security -> Ensures the development of softwares that implements security practices like authentication,
                              authorization and encryption.
                             

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
    i.Mastering complexity
    ii.Mastering process
    iii.Mastering Machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   i. Planning -> Identifying software requirements/scope
   ii. Requirement analysis -> Identifying the final user requirements
   iii. Design -> Building the framework.
   iv. Coding -> Convert the algorithms into tangible code.
   v. Testing -> Identifying and fixing bugs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   Water fall methodolgy -> This is a sequential and linear model that is complete each phase before moving on.
   Agile Methodology -> This is iterative and incremental with multiple cycles

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
     i. Software Developer -> Developing applications, systems and programs using programming languages.
     ii. Quality Assurance Engineer -> Collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirements.
     iii. Project Manager -> Assembles and lead the software development team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
     IDE - Software platform that facilitates the creation of software applications by providing a space for writing, compiling and debuging code.
           E,g Sublime, PyCharm, Visual Studio Code. e.t.c
          importance:
          contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
          can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors
          An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. 
           
     Version Control System -> Are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code every time .
          e.g Git.
          importance:
          i. Collaboration - Enables multiple developers to work on same code base without conflicts
          ii. Change tracking - Records detailed history of changes allowing any analysis of each modification
          iii. Branching and merging 
          iv. Error recovery -> Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors.
          

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

      i. Time constraint -> Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, 
                            often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
                            solution ->adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by 
                                       dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
      ii.Changing Software requirements -> Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes,    
                                           making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' 
                                           needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 

                                    solution -> engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, 
                                    which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design,
                                    which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
      iii. Software accessibility and usability -> Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users.
                                                   solution -> Use scalable architecture.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
    i Unit testing -> Testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by softwares.
    ii. Integration testing -> Verify that different components used by your application can work together.
    iii. Acceptance testing -> Verify if a system satisfies business requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

    i. Prompt engineering -> is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs
    Importance:
    Increased flexibility -> A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links
                             and broad patterns.
    Improved user experience ->  It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language 
                                 modelsâ€™ training data
    Developer control ->  Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. 
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
i. Should Agriculture be taught in school as a subject? -> The topic appears to be vague and uncler since it can be simply a No or Yes question.
You can improve on it by looking for a more broader topic for example. "What's the impact of teaching agriculture to the young students?"
